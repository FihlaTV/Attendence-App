# Manipal Attendence App
An attendance management app developed for the ICT department at Manipal Institute of Technology. This app is meant
to be used by the teaching faculty and automates attendance upload to the server which was previously done manually.
The app fetches the student list for each class and stores it in the device memory. The professor can then mark
attendance for students and this information is periodically uploaded to the server using JSON packets.
